# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Project Overview
In this project I had to pull different columns to decide on the how many employees will be retiring soon and in what departments and titles that will have vaccancies.
## Results
The top 4 titles that will open up are 
  - Engineer
  - Senior Staff
  - Staff
  - Senior Engineer
There are 1550 employees primed for mentoring the next level of employees

## Summary
For the next generation of employees, there are plenty of retiring employees to mentor them. With Engineers, Senior Staff, and Staff having the highest number spots opening up, so it would be best to focus the mentorship program in these positions.
